title:  "Why I'm excited about Elixir"
categories: english code

For many years I've been a proficient Rubyist, working with Ruby [day](http://www.sublimevideo.net) and [night](https://github.com/guard). For 1 year and a half now I'm [working with PHP](https://www.dailymotion.com). PHP was actually my first web programming language, back in 2004. I'm ok to work with PHP but I really miss the excitment of using a more developer friendly language like Ruby.

However, at the same time I want to explore new things –like functional programming, or event-driven programming to name a few– and I feel like there's new kids on the block. I want to embrace the evolution of the server-side web because I don't want to be stuck in a Java (or PHP!) job in 10 years...

Last year I worked for 6 months on a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) project (that was not deployed in production for various reasons). That was a great experience but the paradigm of thinking asynchronously, even using promises (I started with good old callbacks) is kind of fucked-up in my opinion. There should be a better way.

Enter [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org), here's its synopsis:

> Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications.
>
> Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

I must admit I first heard of Elixir from [José Valim](https://github.com/josevalim), which is a much respected guy in the Ruby community. I think he started Elixir as a pure experiment and it ended-up being –in my opinion– one of the best contender for the next-decade server-side programming languages.

What drives my curiosity the most is that its a functional language. These days I hear a lot about functional languages so I want to try one myself.

Also, I really like the *low-latency* part. I've done this [great Elixir & Phoenix tutorial](http://phoenix.thefirehoseproject.com/) (Pheonix is an Elixir web framework, think of it as the Rails of Ruby), and I must admit I was impressed by the page load speed. Of course, it's not a real project blabla but still if you compare it to a similar tutorial in Rails, you can feel the speed.

To be continued...
